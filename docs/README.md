# Chi

Chi is a mod for [rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com/). It is an attempt to
bridge multiple clients together to be able to have two separate colonies
cooperate or feud.

Right now only the source code is available, but maybe one day it will be
developed enough to be put on the steam workshop.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

- C# Compiler
- [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com/)
TBD

### Installing

To install, compile the code:
```
gcc# TBD.c#
```

And move the .dll files to your rimworld mod directory (TODO: figure out how to
do this)

## Running the tests

Functional tests probably won't exist, but im not opposed to them

### And coding style tests

Styling tests ARE a good idea though, clean code is good code
